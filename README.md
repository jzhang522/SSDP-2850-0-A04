# A04 — Advanced CSS - News Style Portfolio Homepage

Design and build a content-dense landing page in the style of a news homepage, using it as a layout and CSS power exercise.

The goal is to:

Work with lots of content on a single page
Plan and implement a complex layout (sections, grids, featured areas, sidebars, etc.)
Use custom properties, advanced selectors, and motion (transforms, transitions, animations) intentionally
This is not about mimicking a specific news brand. It’s about building a news-style layout that could function as a portfolio front page.

You may use your own projects and tips and treat it like a personal portfolio, or you may invent a fictional publication or theme (for example, “Frontend Daily,” “Animation Insider”). Either way, this is a layout and CSS mastery assignment first, and content second.

This project will be carried forward into A05, where you’ll individually refactor and extend the codebase.
